This is a demo \LaTeX template you can use for your QUT confirmation report. The main sources are a template for TU/Eindhoven by Thijs Nugteren and Joos Buijs, and Sareh Sadeghianasl's QUT confirmation report. Only the title page and the appendix are relatively standard, the structure should be heavily adapted for your own research needs.

The command \textbackslash todo\{\} that produces a \todo{The ToDo note} ToDo note in the margin (and introduces some white space in the text unfortunately).

If you go over the page limit, perhaps change the chapters into sections.

Good luck.
